* What is it?

  CL-ORG-MODE-EXTENDED provides representation of DAGs over enriched Org semantics,
  implemented over content-addressed storage (CAS).

* Properties

  * backward-compatible: the extended information is stored in node properties
  * plain (non-extended) Org file import
  * powerful inter-node reference mechanism: content-addressed storage (CAS)
  * exactly the same API as CL-ORG-MODE, modulo the parser entry point

* Testing

  It would suffice to just do:

  #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (require :cl-org-mode-extended-tests)
  (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op :cl-org-mode-extended)
  #+END_SRC

  The tests perform a plain Org import and two serialisation/reparse roundtrips, checking for
  stability of (post-import) text and hashes.
