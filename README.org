* What is it?

  CL-ORG-MODE is a three-component, layered solution for
  manipulation of Org-structured text:

  - CL-ORG-MODE-RAW ::
    provides tolerant parsing of Org-structured text into a semi-detailed AST
  - CL-ORG-MODE (should we call it CL-ORG-MODE-MIDDLE, to avoid confusion?) ::
    "dresses" the AST into a fairly rich object tree, and allows serialisation into text
  - CL-ORG-MODE-EXTENDED ::
    allows representation of DAGs in Org files, atop a CAS (content-addressed storage)
